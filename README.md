### Project Setup 
Notes: npm install should automatically install all the dependencies
___
To get started, first move to the project directory and install the following dependencies:

**npm i bcryptjs body-parser concurrently express is-empty jsonwebtoken mongoose passport passport-jwt validator**

**npm i -D nodemon**

Next, change the current directory to the client folder and install these dependencies:

**npm i axios classnames jwt-decode react-redux react-router-dom redux redux-thunk**

At this point you can change the directory back to the main project folder and enter **npm run dev** in the command line to see the web app in action!
